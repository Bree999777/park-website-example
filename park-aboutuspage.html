<h3>Our Start</h3>
<p>
Fitzgerald’s park first belonged to the Beamish family who owned the wild marshland and “The Shrubberies” which is now the museum on the grounds. The family then sold the house and land to the Bons Secours Sisters in 1886. They enjoyed the house until 1897 when it was bought by Cornelius Desmond who was a member of the Cork Corporation and lived there until it was sold again to the Incorporated Cork International Association in 1901. During this time 8 extra hectares of the marshland surrounding “The Shrubberies” were reclaimed.

<h3>Cork International Exhibition</h3>
<p>
Fitzgerald’s Park was first opened to the public in 1902 with the opening of the Cork International Showcase. This was to show the different trades of Cork and was such a success it didn’t close until October 1903 to allow King Edward VII to attend the event. This is also when the park was named after Edward Fitzgerald who was lord mayor of Cork and planner of the event at the time. The park was completely renovated for the exhibition, they cleared away the unrulily weeds and replaced them with pavilions, kiosks, ornamental walks, tea houses, and even a switch rail. After the events the grounds were handed over to the Corporation of the people of Cork the house was converted into a museum and the park was officially opened to the public in 1910.

<h3>Now</h3>
<p>
The museum building was renovated again in 1996 to add another part to the museum and the cafe behind. The final upgrade of the park was done in 2012 with the addition of the “Sky Garden” and new playground along with other artworks around the park. It’s clear to see this renovation modernized the park to keep it with the times. Take a look yourself and visit Fitzgerald’s park, explore our Cork heritage in the museum, grab a bite to eat in the cafe, and admire the views from our Sky Garden.
